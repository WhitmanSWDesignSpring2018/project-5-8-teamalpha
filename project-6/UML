I tried to use both of the programs that you recommended to create a UML diagram but I could not get either to work. I wanted to create a system where we could reuse the UML diagram cards from project to project. So, I wrote them on there own card and then drew an overview of how our classes fit together. I would really like to learn how to do this in a better way.
