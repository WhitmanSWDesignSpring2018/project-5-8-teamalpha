# User Manual

### Context Menu
Right clicking any playable in the pane will cause a context menu to appear on the layable. It has six menu options:
#### Play Selected
Clicking on the "Play Selected" item will cause the playline and the midiplayer to play from the beginning of the first selected playable to the end of the last selected playable. It will play exactly the notes that were selected when the context menu appeared.
#### Change Volume
Clicking on the "Change Volume" item will cause a dialog with a text field to appear. Entering a number from 0-127 and clicking "OK" will cause the volume of the selected notes to change to the appropriate volume and the brightness of the color to change proportionally.
#### Change Instrument
Clicking on the "Change Instrument" item will cause a dialog with a drop-down menu to appear. Selecting the desired instrument will cause all the selected notes to have the new instrument's sound and color.
#### Group
The same as the "Group" main menu item. Selecting this item groups the selected playables together into a gesture. This item is disabled if only one playable is selected.
#### Ungroup
The same as the "Ungroup" main menu item. Selecting this item ungroups any selected gestures. This item is disabled if there are no selected gestures.
#### Delete
The same as the "Delete" main menu item. Selecting this item deletes the selected playables.

### Note Names and Beats
The names of the appropriate notes now appear in grey at the leftmost edge of the scrollpane and every 1000 pixels. There are grey vertical lines every 50 pixels to represent eighth notes.
