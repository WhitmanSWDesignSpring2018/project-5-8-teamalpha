# GRADE: 76/80 

## Original composition - 5/6 points

| Points Earned | Points Possible | Requirement | Comments
|--------------:|----------------:|-------------|---------
|1|1| A composition is presented.
|0|1| The composition is original.
|4|4| The composition is artistic and/or demonstrates the features of your software.

## Demo - 6/6 points

| Points Earned | Points Possible | Requirement | Comments
|--------------:|----------------:|-------------|---------
|4|4| Each new feature was justified and demonstrated.
|1|1| The composition was played.
|1|1| All team members were included.

## User manual - 6/6 points

| Points Earned | Points Possible | Requirement | Comments
|--------------:|----------------:|-------------|---------
|2|2| There is a file named ```manual.md``` in the top-level directory.
|2|2| It describes each new feature added in Project 8.
|2|2| It explains how to use each new feature.

## Feature selection - 12/12 points

One difficult enhancement may be worth several easier enhancements.

_Some features are not as nicely implemented as they could be, particularly the note names, change volume, and change instrument. However, you implemented a thoughtful set of features, and a lot of them. I appreciate that you struggled with usability for changing note opacity and I am giving you credit for that. I also appreciate that you resolved many bugs._

## Execution -  26/28 points

### Implementation of new features - 20/20 points

* All new features behave as described in the user manual.  If the description in the user manual is incomplete, then the behavior follows standard conventions and is otherwise unsurprising.
* There are no uncaught exceptions from new features.
* There is no debugging output from new features.

### No regressions - 6/8 points

All prior requirements are met, unless they have been superseded by new requirements or are documented by the team as known bugs for this iteration.

_Some serious bugs but they are documented as issues_

## Release - 2/2 points

| Pts Earned | Pts Possible | Requirement | Comments
|-----------:|-------------:|-------------|---------
| 1 | 1 | The release is tagged as ```project-8-release```.
| 1 | 1 | Documentation is in the ```project-8``` directory.

## Reflection and elegance - 19/20 points

| Pts Earned | Pts Possible | Requirement | Comments
|-----------:|-------------:|-------------|---------
| 4 | 4 | UML diagram is accurate and complete.
| 4 | 4 | New classes/methods are reasonably self-explanatory. | _New code seems to be. There is still some missing documentation in older code._
| 2 | 2 | Design overview addresses changes from Project 7 in general.
| 2 | 2 | Design overview addresses the implementation of each new feature.
| 5 | 6 | Assessment of what is elegant and what is not thoughtfully addresses object-oriented design principles. | _I wish you had talked a bit about scalability with this larger composition. What do you think causes the delays with playing and stopping?_
| 1 | 1 | Velocity is presented. | _Nice to see a consistent velocity from the last project! I wonder if this would start to drop further on due to the accumulation of technical debt you discuss._
| 1 | 1 | Team retrospective is presented. | _I appreciate that you worked hard and learned a lot._
